# First Pages

To be honest, the first pages are not very exciting. They mostly consist of simple instructions that donâ€™t do anything particularly meaningful.

## 0x00
```asm
xor      eax, eax
lea      rbx, [0]
loop     $
mov      rdx, 0
and      esi, 0
sub      edi, edi
push     0
pop      rbp
```

These are just different ways to set registers to 0 or to act as a nop (no operation).

## 0x01
```asm
xadd     rax, rdx
loop     .Loop
```

This introduces a simple loop and the `xadd` instruction, which swaps and adds values between two registers.

## 0x02
```asm
neg      rax ; rax = -rax
sbb      rax, rax ; rax = rax - rax - CF
neg      rax ; Again, rax = -rax
```

This sequence might look cryptic at first, but it essentially sets the `rax` register to either 0 or -1, depending on its initial value.

`sbb rax, rax`: Subtracts rax from itself, considering the `carry flag (CF)`. The result will be:
- 0 if `rax` was initially 0.
- -1 if `rax` was non-zero.

`neg rax`: Negates `rax` again, effectively flipping the result back.

### Final Result:
If `rax` starts as 0, the final result is 0.
If `rax` starts as any non-zero value, the final result is 1.
This is a clever trick for normalizing a value to 0 or 1, which can be useful for conditional logic or boolean-like operations in assembly.

#### Explanation: rax = 0
```asm
; rax = 0
neg      rax ; rax = 0
; CF = 0 because 0 is not negative
sbb      rax, rax ; rax = rax - rax - CF = 0 - (0) - 0 = 0.
neg      rax ; rax = 0
```
#### Explanation: rax = 2
```asm
; rax = 2
neg      rax ; rax = -2
; CF = 1 because -2 is negative
sbb      rax, rax ; rax = -2 - (-2) - 1 = -1
neg      rax ; rax = -(-1) = 1
```

As you can see, the result is always 1 or 0.

## 0x03
```asm
sub     rdx, rax ; rdx = rdx - rax | This will change CF
sbb     rcx, rcx ; rcx = rcx - rcx - CF (depends on the above)
and     rax, rax ; rax AND rax. (Not relevant)
add     rax, rcx ; rax = rax + rcx
```

<details>
<summary>Explanation</summary>  
<hr>

This code manipulates registers and uses the `Carry Flag (CF)` to influence the result. The key operation is `sbb rcx, rcx`, which sets `rcx` to `0` if `CF = 0`, or `-1` if `CF = 1`. The `and rax, rax` does not alter the value of `rax` but updates processor flags (irrelevant here). Finally, `rax` is adjusted by adding `rcx`. Depending on the initial values and the state of `CF`, the result can vary. In this example, `CF = 0`, so the code normalizes `rcx` to `0`, leaving `rax` unchanged.

```asm
; rdx = 10
; rax = 5
; rcx = 3

sub     rdx, rax ; rdx = rdx(10) - rax(5) = 5 | CF = 0
sbb     rcx, rcx ; rcx = rcx(3) - rcx(3) - CF(0) = 0
and     rax, rax ; rax AND rax. (Not relevant)
add     rax, rcx ; rax = rax(5) + rcx(0)

; rdx = 5
; rax = 5
; rcx = 0
```

## 0x04
```asm
xor      al, 0x20
```

<details>
<summary>Explanation</summary>  
<hr>

Swap between Uppercase and Lowercase letters. Use `0x20` because in binary it is `0010 0000`, which has a `1` in the 5th bit. That bit is relevant for the Uppercase/Lowercase swap.

```asm
; al   = 0100 0001 = 'A'
; 0x20 = 0010 0000
xor al, 0x20
; al   = 0110 0001 = 'a'
```

```asm
; al   = 0110 0001 = 'a'
; 0x20 = 0010 0000
xor al, 0x20
; al   = 0100 0001 = 'A'
```

## 0x05
```asm
sub      rax, 5
cmp      rax, 4
```

<details>
<summary>Explanation</summary>

```asm
sub      rax, 5 ; rax = rax - 5
cmp      rax, 4 ; rax == 4 ? ZF = 1 : ZF = 0
```

## 0x06
```asm
not      rax
inc      rax
neg      rax
```

<details>
<summary>Explanation</summary>  
<hr>

This sequence might look complex, but in reality, it restores the original value of `rax`.
- Invert all bits.
- Increment by 1.
- Negate rax (multiply by -1).

```asm
; rax = 0000 0101 = 5

not      rax          ; Invert all bits
; rax = 1111 1010 = -6 (two's complement representation)

inc      rax          ; Increment by 1
; rax = 1111 1011 = -5

neg      rax          ; Negate rax (multiply by -1)
; rax = 0000 0101 = 5
```

Final result: `rax` remains unchanged.

## 0x07
```asm
inc      rax
neg      rax
inc      rax
neg      rax
```

<details>
<summary>Explanation</summary>

Similar to the previous one, but with extra steps.

```asm
; rax = 5
inc      rax ; Increment by 1. rax = 6
neg      rax ; Negate rax. rax = -6
inc      rax ; Increment by 1. rax = -5
neg      rax ; Negate rax. rax = 5
```

Final result: `rax` remains unchanged.

## 0x08
```asm
add      rax, rdx
rcr      rax, 1
```

<details>    
<summary>Explanation</summary>  
<hr>

Rotates `rax` right by 1 bit through CF. Changing CF to LSB, MSB to CF, and the remaining bits shift to the right.

```asm
; rax = 5 (0000 0101)
; rdx = 4 (0000 0100)
add      rax, rdx ; rax = rax + rdx = 9 (0000 1001)

; rax = 9 (0000 1001)
rcr      rax, 1
; rcr rotates rax right by 1 bit through CF:
; LSB (1) moves to CF, and CF (0) moves to MSB.
; Final rax = 4 (1000 0100), CF = 1
```
