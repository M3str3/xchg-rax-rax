# First Pages

To be honest, the first pages are not very exciting. They mostly consist of simple instructions that donâ€™t do anything particularly meaningful.

## 0x00
```asm
xor      eax, eax
lea      rbx, [0]
loop     $
mov      rdx, 0
and      esi, 0
sub      edi, edi
push     0
pop      rbp
```

These are just different ways to set registers to 0 or to act as a nop (no operation).

## 0x01
```asm
xadd     rax, rdx
loop     .Loop
```

<details>
<summary>Explanation</summary>  
<hr>

This introduces a simple loop and the `xadd` instruction, which swaps and adds values between two registers.

</details>

## 0x02
```asm
neg      rax ; rax = -rax
sbb      rax, rax ; rax = rax - rax - CF
neg      rax ; Again, rax = -rax
```

<details>
<summary>Explanation</summary>  
<hr>

This sequence might look cryptic at first, but it essentially sets the `rax` register to either 0 or -1, depending on its initial value.

`sbb rax, rax`: Subtracts rax from itself, considering the `carry flag (CF)`. The result will be:
- 0 if `rax` was initially 0.
- -1 if `rax` was non-zero.

`neg rax`: Negates `rax` again, effectively flipping the result back.

### Final Result:
If `rax` starts as 0, the final result is 0.
If `rax` starts as any non-zero value, the final result is 1.
This is a clever trick for normalizing a value to 0 or 1, which can be useful for conditional logic or boolean-like operations in assembly.

#### Explanation: rax = 0
```asm
; rax = 0
neg      rax ; rax = 0
; CF = 0 because 0 is not negative
sbb      rax, rax ; rax = rax - rax - CF = 0 - (0) - 0 = 0.
neg      rax ; rax = 0
```
#### Explanation: rax = 2
```asm
; rax = 2
neg      rax ; rax = -2
; CF = 1 because -2 is negative
sbb      rax, rax ; rax = -2 - (-2) - 1 = -1
neg      rax ; rax = -(-1) = 1
```

As you can see, the result is always 1 or 0.

## 0x03
```asm
sub     rdx, rax ; rdx = rdx - rax | This will change CF
sbb     rcx, rcx ; rcx = rcx - rcx - CF (depends on the above)
and     rax, rax ; rax AND rax. (Not relevant)
add     rax, rcx ; rax = rax + rcx
```

<details>
<summary>Explanation</summary>  
<hr>

This code manipulates registers and uses the `Carry Flag (CF)` to influence the result. The key operation is `sbb rcx, rcx`, which sets `rcx` to `0` if `CF = 0`, or `-1` if `CF = 1`. The `and rax, rax` does not alter the value of `rax` but updates processor flags (irrelevant here). Finally, `rax` is adjusted by adding `rcx`. Depending on the initial values and the state of `CF`, the result can vary. In this example, `CF = 0`, so the code normalizes `rcx` to `0`, leaving `rax` unchanged.

```asm
; rdx = 10
; rax = 5
; rcx = 3

sub     rdx, rax ; rdx = rdx(10) - rax(5) = 5 | CF = 0
sbb     rcx, rcx ; rcx = rcx(3) - rcx(3) - CF(0) = 0
and     rax, rax ; rax AND rax. (Not relevant)
add     rax, rcx ; rax = rax(5) + rcx(0)

; rdx = 5
; rax = 5
; rcx = 0
```

## 0x04
```asm
xor      al, 0x20
```

<details>
<summary>Explanation</summary>  
<hr>

Swap between Uppercase and Lowercase letters. Use `0x20` because in binary it is `0010 0000`, which has a `1` in the 5th bit. That bit is relevant for the Uppercase/Lowercase swap.

```asm
; al   = 0100 0001 = 'A'
; 0x20 = 0010 0000
xor al, 0x20
; al   = 0110 0001 = 'a'
```

```asm
; al   = 0110 0001 = 'a'
; 0x20 = 0010 0000
xor al, 0x20
; al   = 0100 0001 = 'A'
```

</details>

## 0x05
```asm
sub      rax, 5
cmp      rax, 4
```

<details>
<summary>Explanation</summary>  
<hr>

```asm
sub      rax, 5 ; rax = rax - 5
cmp      rax, 4 ; rax == 4 ? ZF = 1 : ZF = 0
```

</details>

## 0x06
```asm
not      rax
inc      rax
neg      rax
```

<details>
<summary>Explanation</summary>  
<hr>

This sequence might look complex, but in reality, it restores the original value of `rax`.
- Invert all bits.
- Increment by 1.
- Negate rax (multiply by -1).

```asm
; rax = 0000 0101 = 5

not      rax          ; Invert all bits
; rax = 1111 1010 = -6 (two's complement representation)

inc      rax          ; Increment by 1
; rax = 1111 1011 = -5

neg      rax          ; Negate rax (multiply by -1)
; rax = 0000 0101 = 5
```

Final result: `rax` remains unchanged.

</details>

## 0x07
```asm
inc      rax
neg      rax
inc      rax
neg      rax
```

<details>
<summary>Explanation</summary>  
<hr>

Similar to the previous one, but with extra steps.

```asm
; rax = 5
inc      rax ; Increment by 1. rax = 6
neg      rax ; Negate rax. rax = -6
inc      rax ; Increment by 1. rax = -5
neg      rax ; Negate rax. rax = 5
```

Final result: `rax` remains unchanged.

</details>

## 0x08
```asm
add      rax, rdx
rcr      rax, 1
```

<details>    
<summary>Explanation</summary>  
<hr>

Rotates `rax` right by 1 bit through CF. Changing CF to LSB, MSB to CF, and the remaining bits shift to the right.

```asm
; rax = 5 (0000 0101)
; rdx = 4 (0000 0100)
add      rax, rdx ; rax = rax + rdx = 9 (0000 1001)

; rax = 9 (0000 1001)
rcr      rax, 1
; rcr rotates rax right by 1 bit through CF:
; LSB (1) moves to CF, and CF (0) moves to MSB.
; Final rax = 4 (1000 0100), CF = 1
```

</details>

## 0x09

```asm
shr      rax,3
adc      rax,0
```

<details>    
<summary>Explanation</summary>  
<hr>

`shr` shifts the bits of the register to the right by 3, the third bit moved go to `CF`. Then, `adc` its the same as `add` but with carry, so if the value of `CF` is 1 it adds 1 to the result of sum.

```asm
; rax = 12(0000 1100)
shr      rax,3
; rax = 1(0000 0001)
adc      rax,0 ; rax = rax(1) + 0 + CF(1)
; rax = 2(0000 0010)
```

</details>

## 0x0A

```asm
    add      byte [rdi],1
.loop:
    inc      rdi
    adc      byte [rdi],0
    loop     .loop
```

<details>    
<summary>Explanation</summary>  
<hr>

Start by adding 1 to the byte at the address pointed to by `rdi`. Then, a loop runs for i iterations (`rcx`), during which the carry flag(`CF`) is added to the next byte in memory

```asm
; rcx = 3
; rdi = **memory position**

    add      byte [rdi],1 ;  Add 1 to the byte at [rdi], update Carry Flag (CF) if overflow occurs
.loop:
    inc      rdi ; Next byte
    adc      byte [rdi],0 ; Add 0 + CF state. Restore CF to 0
    loop     .loop ; Decrement rcx and jump to .loop if rcx > 0

; 3 iterations
```

</details>

## 0x0B

```asm
not      rdx
neg      rax
sbb      rdx,-1
```

<details>    
<summary>Explanation</summary>  
<hr>

Start by taking the bitwise NOT of `rdx`, flipping all bits. Then, negate `rax` by taking its two's complement (inverting the bits and adding 1). Finally, subtract -1 from `rdx` using `sbb`, which also accounts for the state of the carry flag (`CF`).

```asm
; rax = 01000
; rdx = 01000
; CF = 0 

not      rdx ; rdx = 10111
neg      rax ; rax = 11000 
sbb      rdx, -1 ; 10111 - (-1) - CF = 11000
```

## 0x0C
```asm
mov      rcx,rax
xor      rcx,rbx
ror      rcx,0xd

ror      rax,0xd
ror      rbx,0xd
xor      rax,rbx

cmp      rax,rcx
```

<details>
<summary>Explanation</summary>  
<hr>

A bit of a strange one. This code operates on `rax` and `rcx` by performing an XOR operation against `rbx` and rotating 13 bits to the right.

In the case of `rcx`, XOR is performed against `rbx` first, followed by the rotation. In the case of `rax`, the rotation comes first, followed by an XOR with the rotated `rbx`.

```asm

mov      rcx,rax ; Equal rcx and rax

xor      rcx,rbx ; RCX: XOR against rbx
ror      rcx,0xd ; RCX: Rotate 13 bits

ror      rax,0xd ; RAX: Rotate 13 bits
ror      rbx,0xd ; rbx rotation to equal result
xor      rax,rbx ; RAX: XOR against rbx

cmp      rax,rcx ; Compare RCX AND RAX
```

## 0x0D

```asm
mov      rdx,rbx
xor      rbx,rcx
and      rbx,rax

and      rdx,rax
and      rax,rcx
xor      rax,rdx

cmp      rax,rbx
```

<details>
<summary>Explanation</summary>  
<hr>

Performs a series of bitwise operations on registers (`rdx`, `rbx`, `rax`, and `rcx`).Finally, compares the final values of `rax` and `rbx`.

- `mov rdx, rbx`: copies the value of `rbx` into `rdx`, preserving the original value of `rbx` for later use.

- `xor rbx, rcx`: performs a bitwise XOR between `rbx` and `rcx`, storing the result in `rbx`.

- `and rbx, rax`:Performs a bitwise AND between `rbx` (result of the XOR) and `rax`, storing the result in `rbx`. This filters `rbx` to keep only the bits that are 1 in both `rbx` and `rax`.

- `and  rdx, rax`: Filters the original value of `rbx` (stored in `rdx`) by performing a bitwise AND with `rax`.

- `and rax, rcx`: Filters `rax` by performing a bitwise AND with `rcx`.

- `xor rax, rdx`: Performs a bitwise XOR between the new value of `rax` and `rdx`.

- `cmp rax, rbx`: Compares the final values of `rax` and `rbx`. The result affects the processor's flags, potentially influencing subsequent conditional instructions.

The important thing about this is that `rax` and `rbx` are the same at the end. I wrote a code where you can compile and check it yourself

```asm

    msg_equal db "They are equal", 10 ; Message for equality with a newline

This snippet involves some cool bitwise operations like NOT, AND, and OR, ending with a comparison.


`mov rcx, rax`: Copies the value of `rax` into `rcx`.

`and rcx, rbx`: Performs a bitwise AND between `rcx` (copy of `rax`) and `rbx`, storing the result in `rcx`.

`not rcx`: Inverts all the bits of `rcx`.

`not rax`: Inverts all the bits of `rax`.

`not rbx`: Inverts all the bits of `rbx`.

`or rax, rbx`: Performs a bitwise OR between `rax` and `rbx`, storing the result in `rax`. The result has 1 in every bit position where either `rax` or `rbx` is 1.

`cmp rax, rcx`: Compares the final values of `rax` and `rcx`, setting the processor flags for a potential conditional branch.

## 0x0F
```asm
.loop:
    xor      byte [rsi],al
    lodsb
    loop     .loop
```

<details>
<summary>Explanation</summary>  
<hr>

This code loops through a series of bytes in memory, applying an XOR with the al register to each byte:

- `xor byte [rsi], al`: Bitwise XOR the byte at memory [rsi] with al (the low byte of rax), storing the result back into [rsi].
- `lodsb`: Load the next byte from [rsi] into al, incrementing rsi automatically (assuming the direction flag is clear).
- `loop .loop`: Decrement rcx, and if it's not zero, jump back to .loop.

As each byte is processed, the result at `[rsi]` is altered by `XOR` with `al`. This can be a method of simple encryption/decryption if the same key (`al`) is used.
