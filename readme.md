# xchg rax, rax - Challenge Solutions

This repository contains solutions and explanations for the challenges presented in the book **"xchg rax, rax"** by *xorpd*. Each challenge explores concepts in x86-64 assembly programming, reverse engineering, and low-level system operations.

# Whats means "xchg rax, rax"?
The phrase **"xchg rax, rax"** refers to an assembly instruction that exchanges the value of the `rax` register with itself. In practice, this operation does absolutely nothing, as the value remains unchanged. 

This instruction is often used humorously to symbolize a "no-op" (no operation) or as a placeholder in low-level programming. The title of the book plays on this irony, reflecting the deep yet playful nature of assembly language exploration.
