# Whats means "xchg rax, rax"?
The phrase **"xchg rax, rax"** refers to an assembly instruction that exchanges the value of the `rax` register with itself. In practice, this operation does absolutely nothing, as the value remains unchanged. 

This instruction is used humorously to symbolize a no-op. The title of the book plays on this irony.
